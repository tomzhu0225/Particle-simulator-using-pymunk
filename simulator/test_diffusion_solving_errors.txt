This was done by defining a poof button in the diffusion GUI, when testing it, we had this problem:

If a user presses it two times, we get an error saying that the wall isn't in the display anymore (of course)
wa didn't want to have such errors as we wanted to program to run smoothly, so we added a try except structure
that gives a pop up if the wall has already been poofed.
You can test that in the main.py file.

PS:
Wa had many problems like this, we got errors left and right after closing files etc, so we made sure to debug
them, put try except structures where we needed so we can make sure we don't get a meaningless error (after the simulation is done, and closing the window, the program still wants to update it/ update the display,
so we stopped that.)

Also, to make sure the diffusion window runs smoothly, we added a stop graphing button so the user only gets the graph in the moments he wants.
